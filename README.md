A) As the algorithm starts it requires importing list called "list". Then sets n as a length of a "list". Next 2 for loops go through every single object in "list and chectk whether there is the same value, if there is one duplicate script returns true and stops whole function but if there is not duplicates, algorithm will return false.

B) First for loop is going to happen n times, and 2nd for loop inside is going to happen n times for each value in a first for loop making this algorithm quadratic.

C) Algorithm was modified fo it takes half of time because every object in the list is connecting only once with the other ones rather than twice how it was before script was eddited.

D) Algorithm will run aproximately twice as fast because there will be half less calculations because how algorithm is structured now.

E) I think that algorithm will still be a quadratic buth with less steep distribution.

F) Best case performance of this function is O(n) and the worst case performance is O(nlogn). Source: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-July/026837.html

G) sort function = O(nlogn), linear function (for loop) = O(n) therefore this algorithm = O(nlogn + n) function will be 

H) Even if the change in firest algorithm will be aplied it wont run faster than the second algorithm as the first one is a quadriatic expression where as second algorithm is mixture of linear and logarithmic complexity.

I) In terms of these two exapmles of pseudo code I think that programmer could use a slower algorithm because it can work in any other programming language that does not have "sort" function built in, programmer also may not have a knowledge of existance of "sort" function in python or does not know ways to well optymalise code.
